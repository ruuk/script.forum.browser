Message Editor Help
@item:titlebutton=Set Title Button
Clicking this button will bring up an input where you can enter a title to the message.
@item:editlist=Edit List
This lists the lines of the message.
Clicking a line will let you edit that line. You can use normal BB formatting codes.
The context menu has options to add a line before the selected line, or delete the selected line.
@item:buttons=Buttons
The 'Add Line' button brings up an input where you can enter the text of the line. You can use normal BB formatting codes.

The 'Add Lines' button is the same as the 'Add Line' button except that when you are done with the line, it will bring up a new input for the next line. Use the previous menu button to exit.

The 'Send Message' or 'Post Reply' button sends the message.
@item:preview=Preview
This view shows the message as it will appear in Forum Browser message views, which is the best approximation it can make of normal web style formatting.
