  XBMC doesn't have a multi-line text input so I had to do some fancy tricks to make to make this work.

  Use CTRL-\ for backslash otherwise you'll just toggle fullscreen and there's nothing I can do about that :)
  Controls: Use the context menu button/right mouse click for options. CTRL-PgUp/PgDn will operate on
    the preview window.
