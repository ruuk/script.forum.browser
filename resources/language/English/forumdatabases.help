Forum Databases Help
@item:fb=Forum Browser
Browse and search user contributed forums in the Forum Browser online database.

While this includes Tapatalk and Forumrunner forums, it only has those which were added to the database by the addon users.

Also includes Parser Browser forums, which are forums which do not use Tapatalk or Forumrunner and are handled by the internal Parser Browser.
