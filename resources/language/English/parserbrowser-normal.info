[B]Notes:[/B] ([COLOR FF880000]Please Read[/COLOR])

This forum [I]appears[/I] to be compatible with the Forum Browser's [B]Parser Browser[/B].

The [B]Parser Browser[/B] works by parsing forum pages, and extracting the relevant forum data for display within Forum Browser.
While the [B]Parser Browser[/B] attempts to handle the differences in forum page formatting, the wide range of possible formats means that it may fail in some cases.

The most likely issue will be errors in post display, such as extra text, incorrect user stats, blank posts etc.
Also not all features will be available with all forums, and some features may not work correctly (ie posting, subscribing, viewing private messages)

That being said, many forums will work quite well :)

Please feel free to let me (ruuk) know of any major issues in the Forum Browser support thread at forum.xbmc.org. I can't promise I'll fix it, but I'm improving the [B]Parser Browser[/B] all the time and any feedback will help.
